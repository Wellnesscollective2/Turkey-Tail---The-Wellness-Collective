# Turkey-Tail---The-Wellness-Collective
Turkey tail mushroom looks just as you’d imagine it – like a fanned-out turkey tail with stripes of varying colors radiating out from the edges. Turkey tail is a polypore, meaning the fruiting body grows on the underside of the mushroom. It grows on fallen and dead trees and is quite abundant worldwide. This mushroom is best used as a tea because of its super chewy texture, although turkey tail can be eaten as-is (if you really wanted to). Additionally, the prebiotics and antioxidant properties in turkey tail help to support and guard your gut. To know more: https://www.thewellnesscollective.in/blogs/twc-editorial/turkey-tail
